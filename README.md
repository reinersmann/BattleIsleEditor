# BattleIsleEditor
Map editors for Battle Isle, History Line and expansions. Platform: Amiga (Motorola 68k assembly language)

The editors have been written about 30 years ago in assembly language on an Amiga 500 and later Amiga 4000.
The source code is neither documented nor commented.
It was my first (and last) program written in this languange so do not expect anything too fancy :-)
On the bright side: the program still works for example in WinUAE!

The GUI texts and manual are written in German.
