# BattleIsleEditor
Map editors for Battle Isle, History Line and expansions. Platform: Amiga (Motorola 68k assembly language)

The editors have been written about 30 years ago in assembly language on an Amiga 500 and later Amiga 4000.<br>
The source code is neither documented nor commented.<br>
It was my first (and last) program written in this languange so do not expect anything too fancy :-)<br>
On the bright side: the program still works for example in WinUAE!<br>
<br>
The GUI texts and manuals are written in German.
